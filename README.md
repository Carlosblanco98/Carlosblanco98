\# Hi — I'm Carlos Blanco 👋



Help Desk -> Cloud Engineer (AZ-900, AZ-104) • migrating into Azure cloud operations \& infrastructure



Short pitch

\- I’m transitioning from Help Desk to cloud engineering and SRE-focused work. I hold AZ-900 and AZ-104 and I’m actively building automation and infrastructure projects to demonstrate IaC, deployments, and monitoring on Azure.

\- I’m attending TechTO and open to junior cloud/infra, platform, or cloud operations roles (Toronto/remote).



Key skills

\- Cloud: Microsoft Azure (AZ-900, AZ-104), App Services, Azure VMs, Storage, Virtual Network

\- IaC / Automation: Terraform, ARM/Bicep, Azure CLI, PowerShell

\- DevOps fundamentals: Git, GitHub Actions, CI/CD, container basics (Docker)

\- Observability \& ops: basic logging/monitoring, alerting, runbook creation

\- Other: Windows \& Linux troubleshooting, scripting (PowerShell, Bash), networking fundamentals



What I’m doing now

\- Building short projects that show: provisioning with Terraform, a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions, and a simple app deployed to Azure.

\- Uploading my resume and polishing this profile for TechTO.



Resume

Pinned projects (suggest these repos to create \& pin)

\- cloud-showcase — small demo: Terraform + sample app + GitHub Actions deploy to Azure App Service

\- infra-scripts — reusable PowerShell / Azure CLI scripts for VM provisioning and automation

\- helpdesk-to-cloud-notes — short notes / mini-posts describing migrations, troubleshooting steps, and what I learned (great to show growth)
